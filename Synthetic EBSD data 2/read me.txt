1. The ctf files used for the experiments are found in "ctf files" folder.

2. We project the orientation data in ctf format onto the fundamental region using https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/releases/download/mtex-4.0.23/mtex-4.0.23.zip in matlab

3. We save the projected orientation maps as .mat files in the "mat folder".

Thus, the two folders contain the same data that differ by a symmetry.
In our experiments for the paper, we used the "mat files" to allow for easier comparison with the experiments in the mtex paper.
